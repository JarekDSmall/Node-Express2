### Conceptual Exercise

Answer the following questions below:

1. What is a JWT?

JWT stands for JSON Web Token. It is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.

2. What is the signature portion of the JWT? What does it do?

The signature portion of the JWT is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way. It is generated by taking the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, and using an algorithm specified in the header to produce the signature.

3. If a JWT is intercepted, can the attacker see what's inside the payload?

Yes, if a JWT is intercepted, the attacker can decode the payload and see its contents because the payload is just base64 encoded, not encrypted. However, without the secret, they cannot verify its authenticity or tamper with it without detection.

4. How can you implement authentication with a JWT? Describe how it works at a high level.

At a high level, JWT authentication works as follows:
User logs in with credentials.
Server verifies credentials and generates a JWT with a payload containing user information and possibly some expiration time.
Server sends the JWT back to the client.
Client stores the JWT (often in local storage) and sends it along with every subsequent request to the server.
Server decodes and verifies the JWT signature with every request to ensure it's valid and not tampered with.
If the JWT is valid, the server processes the request; otherwise, it returns an authentication error.

5. Compare and contrast unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

Unit Tests: Test individual units/components of a software in isolation (e.g., functions, methods). They are fast and help in identifying issues early in the development cycle.
Integration Tests: Test the interaction between integrated units/components. They ensure that integrated parts of an application function as expected together.
End-to-End Tests: Test the flow of an application as a user would experience it. They ensure that the entire application functions correctly in real-world scenarios.

6. What is a mock? What are some things you would mock?

A mock is an object or procedure used to mimic real-world objects or procedures in testing. You would mock things like:
External services or APIs to avoid making actual calls.
Database operations to avoid actual CRUD operations.
System resources or functions to control their behavior during testing.

7. What is continuous integration?

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration is then verified by an automated build and automated tests to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.

8. What is an environment variable and what are they used for?

An environment variable is a variable outside of the application that stores configuration information. They are used for:
Storing secrets or credentials safely without hardcoding them into the application.
Configuring different environments like development, testing, and production.
Making applications more portable and environment-agnostic.

9. What is TDD? What are some benefits and drawbacks?

TDD, or Test-Driven Development, is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code.
Benefits: Improved code quality, easier refactoring, faster feedback loop, and better documentation through tests.
Drawbacks: Initial development might be slower, requires a learning curve, and might lead to overemphasis on testing over actual functionality.

10. What is the value of using JSONSchema for validation?

JSONSchema provides a clear and concise way to describe the expected format of JSON data. It allows for:
Consistent data validation.
Self-documenting APIs or data formats.
Easier integration with other systems by sharing the schema.

11. What are some ways to decide which code to test?

Prioritize testing for:
Critical paths or business logic.
Complex functions or algorithms.
Areas with frequent changes or high defect rates.
Edge cases and boundary conditions.

12. What does RETURNING do in SQL? When would you use it?

The RETURNING clause in SQL is used to return values of the inserted or updated rows. It's commonly used when you want to know the value of auto-generated fields (like IDs) after an insert operation.

13. What are some differences between Web Sockets and HTTP?

Web Sockets: Provides a full-duplex communication channel over a single, long-lived connection. It's used for real-time applications like chat or live updates.
HTTP: Stateless, request-response protocol. Each request opens a new connection.

14. Did you prefer using Flask over Express? Why or why not (there is no right answer here --- we want to see how you think about technology)?

I did not have a preference over either, if I am being honest.

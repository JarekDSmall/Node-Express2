BUG #1: SQL Injection Vulnerability in users.js Route

Description: The SQL query in the router.get("/:username", ...) route in users.js was vulnerable to SQL injection.
Fix: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

BUG #2: Missing Token Expiry in createToken.js

Description: The JWT tokens generated by the createToken function in createToken.js did not have an expiration time set.
Fix: Set the expiresIn option to '1h' in the jwt.sign() method.

BUG #3: Potential Unhandled Promise Rejection in auth.js Route

Description: The router.post("/register", ...) route in auth.js did not handle potential promise rejections when registering a user.
Fix: Add a check to ensure that the User.register(req.body) method successfully returns a user.

BUG #4: Incomplete JWT Verification in auth.js Middleware

Description: The authenticateJWT middleware function in auth.js did not properly verify the JWT token.
Fix: Extract the JWT token from the request body and verify it using the jwt.verify() method.

BUG #5: Potential Missing Error Handling in partialUpdate.js

Description: The sqlForPartialUpdate function in partialUpdate.js did not handle potential errors related to invalid column names.
Fix: Add a check to ensure that the provided colName exists in the jsToSql mapping.

BUG #6: Multiple module.exports in app.js

Description: The app.js file contains two module.exports statements. The second module.exports overrides the first one, which means that only the error-handling middleware is exported, and not the main Express app instance. This can lead to unexpected behavior if other parts of the application are trying to import the app object from app.js.
Fix: Combine the exports into a single object export, ensuring that both the app object and the error-handling middleware are available for use in other parts of the application.
